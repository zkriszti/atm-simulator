# ATM Screen Simulator

This is a small "just for fun & practice" project that simulates an ATM screen. A lovely ATM that won't drain your bank account. ;)

There are some ATMs that let you choose what banknotes you need, ie. if you are going to withdraw 500 EUR, you can specify to receive 3 x 100 + 2 x 50 + 5 x 20 EUR (or whatever currency) banknotes instead of just getting it as 5 x 100 EUR notes. This is a really useful function which gave me the idea of building it in JS for learning purposes.
